## Notes

I got caught up here and there but nothing out of the ordinary for web development. Research, see what other people have done, and implement it myself! The silliest one was with the optional box shadows. I accidentally typed button.classlist (I didn't capitilize the "L") and spent longer than I'd like to admit tracking it down. Start with the most simple solutions first! Also Kap is not the most user friendly app I've ever used.
